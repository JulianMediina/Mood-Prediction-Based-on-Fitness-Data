# Mood-Prediction-Based-on-Fitness-Data
A machine learning project aimed at predicting a user's mood based on fitness activity data. The dataset includes key features such as steps, distance, active minutes, sleep hours, heart rate, and calories burned. The model is built using a neural network to predict calories burned and determine the impact of physical activity on the user's mood.
